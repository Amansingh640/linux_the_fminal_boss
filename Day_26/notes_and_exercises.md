### Key Script Examples

**Initial Setup Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/setup/initial-setup.sh

set -e

echo "Starting TechStart Infrastructure Setup..."

# Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Set hostname
hostname techstart-web-01
echo "techstart-web-01" > /etc/hostname

# Install essential packages
apt install -y git curl wget vim htop fail2ban ufw

echo "Initial setup completed successfully!"
```

**Backup Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/backup/backup.sh

BACKUP_DIR="/backup"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
LOG_FILE="/var/log/backup.log"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup web content
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/web-content-$DATE.tar.gz" /var/www/

# Backup configurations
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/configs-$DATE.tar.gz" /etc/nginx/ /etc/ssh/

# Log backup completion
echo "$(date): Backup completed - $DATE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
